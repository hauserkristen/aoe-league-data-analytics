# Age of Empires 2 DE - League Data Analytics Web Page

AoE2 is a RTS video game and League of Empires was a 3v3 league where teams would play a series against another team in their group each week. This repo utilized the DB that stored records and the aoe2.net API to gather useful data and aggregate it by season, group and team. This provided insight to other teams, on which maps and civs had been chosen and were likely going to be played again.
